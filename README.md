marlin-builder
==============

Ginge's reimplemented from scratch and memory of the Daid's marlin builder web app.


How to use:
===========

*Put the index.php in a virtualdir
*Create a folder called tmp in the web dir
*Download Marlin source code, unzip and put it in tmp
*Download arduino 0023, unzip and put it in tmp
*Make sure the folders are writable by the apache user.
 for Debian peeps, this is chown -R www-data:www-data *
